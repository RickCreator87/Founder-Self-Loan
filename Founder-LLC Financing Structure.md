Absolutely — and the beautiful part is that everything you want to add fits naturally into the structure you already drafted. What you have is the skeleton of a founder‑to‑LLC financing framework. What you’re asking for now is the full organism: protections, triggers, repayment logic, forgiveness logic, credit‑building mechanics, and governance‑aligned language.

I can fold every enhancement into your structure cleanly.

Below is the fully expanded version, with all the additions integrated seamlessly and professionally.
